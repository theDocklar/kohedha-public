# Location Search Guide for Sanity Studio

## Overview
The deals and events now have an enhanced location field that includes a search functionality to automatically get GPS coordinates.

## How to Use Location Search

### 1. Basic Location Information
- **Venue/Business Name**: Enter the name of the venue, restaurant, or business
- **Street Address**: Enter the full street address
- **City**: Enter the city (required field)
- **District**: Enter the district or area within the city
- **Postal Code**: Enter the postal/ZIP code
- **Country**: Defaults to "Sri Lanka"

### 2. Using the Search Functionality
- **Search Query Field**: This is where you can search for locations to get automatic coordinates
- Type a location name, address, or landmark (e.g., "Galle Face Green", "Colombo Fort", "Mount Lavinia Beach")
- The search will automatically populate the coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- You can then manually adjust the other fields if needed

### 3. GPS Coordinates
- **Latitude**: Automatically filled from search results
- **Longitude**: Automatically filled from search results
- These coordinates can be used for map integration on your website

## Search Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Use specific location names rather than general areas
2. **Include Landmarks**: Mention nearby landmarks or well-known places
3. **Use Local Names**: Use the local names that people would recognize
4. **Check Results**: Verify that the search results match your intended location

## Example Search Queries

- "Galle Face Green, Colombo"
- "Mount Lavinia Beach Hotel"
- "Colombo Fort Railway Station"
- "Barefoot Gallery, Colombo"
- "Dutch Hospital, Galle"

## Benefits

- **Automatic Coordinates**: No need to manually look up GPS coordinates
- **Consistent Data**: Standardized location format across all deals and events
- **Map Integration**: Coordinates enable mapping functionality on your website
- **Better UX**: Users can easily find and navigate to locations

## Troubleshooting

- If search doesn't return results, try different search terms
- Ensure the location is in Sri Lanka (search is limited to Sri Lankan locations)
- For very specific locations, you may need to manually enter some details
- Coordinates are automatically populated but can be manually adjusted if needed
